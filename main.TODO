Stuff I want to remember:

Overview:
  ☐ JSHint
  ☐ Gulp
  ☐ Browserify
  ☐ Test tools - mocha, chai, sinon? It's what I usually use but seems overkill - so much configuration! - and has changed a fair bit since I last dug in. I suspect I could get up to speed with an alternative just as quickly...

Tech debt / tasks:
  ☐ Review the .jshintrc global options
