# Scaffold gulp
My tailored scaffold project for a gulp project. I'll use this to refresh, review and (I hope!) end up with a useful shell project containing tools and settings I'm familiar with.

## Goals
The project will also have jshint, browserify, and test suite setup (probably mocha, chai, sinon but that's maybe overkill so tbc).
